<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>I'm an economist by training and data scientist by necessity. I started my coding journey in the statistical programming tool SAS around 2008 and it's been a winding road ever since. I’m fascinated by how the open source community operates and hope this little blog returns something of value, however small, to the community that's taught me so much. Grad school provided me with a solid foundation in economics, statistics, and econometrics but any programming ability I have comes from the internet and all the geniuses out there nice enough to share their big brains with the world. </p>
<p>My professional life mostly involves applied economic analysis which means data is a big part of my day. I’ve worked mostly in and around the federal government where tools like SAS and Stata are usually available but R and Python lead the way in all things data these days so that's where all the fun is. I work primarily on time series data in Python and SQL so that’s mostly what I’ll write about here. </p>
<p>I currently work for a financial regulator so it’s worth noting that I won’t write about any work I do there. All topics covered are purely my own hobby projects or things I found interesting, useful, and worth sharing. </p>
